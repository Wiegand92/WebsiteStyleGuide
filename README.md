#Website Style Guide

##What is it?

This is a project for CodeCademy to build a reference sheet for building a website. I wanted to make it reusable so I am adding in javascript and forms.

##RoadMap

-I need to read more on validating forms and  how to make the forms secure, while adding the ability to link to google font sheets.

-Need to fill out the text styles with fontFamily, fontSize, textDecoration, and add javascript to these.

-Make border size adjustable.
